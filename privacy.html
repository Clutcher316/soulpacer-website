        <div class="highlight">
            <p><strong>Summary:</strong> Soul Pacer respects your privacy. We collect only the data needed to match music to your workout pace. Your data stays on your device. We do not sell your information to anyone.</p>
        </div>

        <h2>1. Introduction</h2>
        <p>Soul Pacer ("we," "our," or "the app") is a fitness application that matches music BPM (beats per minute) to your workout pace in real-time. This Privacy Policy explains what information we collect, how we use it, and your rights regarding your data.</p>
        <p>By using Soul Pacer, you agree to the collection and use of information as described in this policy. If you do not agree, please do not use the app.</p>

        <h2>2. Information We Collect</h2>

        <h3>2a. Data Collected Automatically</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Motion &amp; Fitness Data:</strong> We use your device's accelerometer and pedometer (via Apple's Core Motion framework) to detect your walking, running, or cycling cadence. This data is processed entirely on your device and is never transmitted to external servers.</li>
            <li><strong>Location Data (When In Use):</strong> With your permission, we access your location while the app is in use to track your workout route and calculate distance. Location data is stored locally on your device and is not shared with third parties.</li>
            <li><strong>Music Library Access:</strong> With your permission, we access your device's music library to find and play songs that match your workout pace. We do not upload, copy, or transmit your music files.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>2b. Data You Provide</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Workout Preferences:</strong> Activity type selections (Running, Walking, Cycling, Rowing, HIIT), genre preferences, weekly schedule settings, and favorite songs.</li>
            <li><strong>Profile Information:</strong> Your display name (used locally for greetings and social features). No email, phone number, or account creation is required.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>2c. Data We Do NOT Collect</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>We do not collect your name, email address, or phone number</li>
            <li>We do not collect payment or financial information</li>
            <li>We do not collect health records or medical data</li>
            <li>We do not use cookies or tracking technologies</li>
            <li>We do not create advertising profiles</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>3. How We Use Your Information</h2>
        <p>All data processing happens locally on your device. We use the collected information exclusively to:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Detect your workout pace and match music BPM in real-time</li>
            <li>Track workout distance, duration, and route</li>
            <li>Provide AI-powered voice coaching during workouts</li>
            <li>Display your workout history and progress</li>
            <li>Manage your favorite songs and playlists</li>
            <li>Enable social features (Pace Vibes) within the app</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>4. Data Storage &amp; Security</h2>
        <div class="highlight">
            <p><strong>All your data stays on your device.</strong> Soul Pacer does not have backend servers. Your workout history, preferences, favorite songs, and settings are stored locally using Apple's secure on-device storage (UserDefaults and the app sandbox).</p>
        </div>
        <p>If you delete the app, all locally stored data is permanently removed from your device.</p>

        <h2>5. Third-Party Services</h2>
        <p>Soul Pacer may integrate with the following third-party music services in future updates:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Apple Music:</strong> If you choose to connect Apple Music, playback is handled through Apple's MusicKit framework. Apple's privacy policy applies to data processed by Apple Music.</li>
            <li><strong>Spotify:</strong> If you choose to connect Spotify, playback is handled through Spotify's iOS SDK. Spotify's privacy policy applies to data processed by Spotify.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>These integrations are optional. The app functions fully using your device's local music library without connecting any third-party service.</p>

        <h2>6. Children's Privacy</h2>
        <p>Soul Pacer is not directed at children under 13 years of age. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children under 13. If you are a parent or guardian and believe your child has provided us with personal information, please contact us at the email below.</p>

        <h2>7. Your Rights</h2>
        <p>Because all data is stored locally on your device, you have full control:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Access:</strong> All your data is visible within the app (workout history, favorites, settings)</li>
            <li><strong>Deletion:</strong> Delete the app to remove all data, or use "Reset All Settings" in the Profile tab</li>
            <li><strong>Permissions:</strong> Revoke Location, Motion, or Music Library access at any time in your device's Settings app</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>8. Changes to This Policy</h2>
        <p>We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. Changes will be posted on this page with an updated effective date. We encourage you to review this policy periodically.</p>
